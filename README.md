Overview
Exponential Distribution vs. Central Limit Theorem
In this project, we will be comparing the exponential distribution to the Central Limit Theorem.  
We are first comparing the sample mean to the theoretical mean of the distribution. 
Second, comparing how variable the sample is (via variance) to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
Lastly, showing that the distribution is approximately normal.
